The grid is 8x8 instead of 4x4

A derivative of [2048](https://play2048.co), which is A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://cam-Robertson.github.io/9007199254740992/)
